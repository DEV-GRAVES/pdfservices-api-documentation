# Overview
## What is Digital Seal?
Digital Seal on a PDF means to digitally sign a PDF document. Digital Seal, alias Digital Signature is a specific type 
of signature that is backed by a digital certificate, providing proof of your identity. Digital signatures are recognized 
as being more secure because theyâ€™re cryptographically bound to the signed document and can be verified. 
When you use a digital certificate obtained from a trusted third party, the resulting digital signature is 
virtually impossible to spoof. It also provides powerful evidence of signer identity, that the signed document was not 
altered, and that the signatures are valid.

## Components of Digital Seal

**PDF Document**

Digital Seal API requires a PDF document as an input file on which a seal has to be applied.

**Sealing Parameters**

Digital Seal API requires a few input parameters for the creation of a seal. The parameters should specify the type, 
format, visibility and appearance of the seal. It should also have the certificate credentials required to communicate with Trust Service Providers.<br/>

Refer [sealing parameters](/overview/digital-seal-api/quickstarts/#2-configure-sealing-parameters) for more details.

**Digital Seal API**

Digital Seal API enables the generation of digital seal on PDF documents with no user interaction. It uses the provided 
sealing parameters to authorize the client and apply seal on the input PDF document. The generated PDF document is said
to be bound to the specified legal entity.

## FAQ
<details><summary>Digital Signature vs Electronic Signature ?</summary><p>

Electronic Signature is a broad term referring to any electronic process that indicates acceptance of 
an agreement or a record. Typical e-signature solutions use common electronic authentication methods to verify signer 
identity, such as an email address, a corporate ID, or a phone PIN. If increased security is needed, multifactor 
authentication may be used. 
<br/>
Digital Signature is one specific type of e-signature that use certificate-based digital IDs to authenticate signer 
identity and demonstrate proof of signing by binding each signature to the document with encryption. Validation occurs 
through trusted certificate authorities (CAs) or trust service providers (TSPs).
